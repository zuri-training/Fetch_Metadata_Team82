    proprietary notices intact. Further rights may be granted on the purchase of any services that we make available on
    the Site (‘Services’), which are governed by our Subscription Terms. Any use of the Site or the Site Content other
    than as specifically authorized herein, without the prior written permission of METADATA.ORG, is strictly prohibited
    and will immediately terminate the license granted herein without further notice to you and you must, at our option,
    return or destroy any copies of the materials you have made. Such unauthorized use may also violate applicable laws

    Except where expressly stated herein, nothing in these Terms of Use shall be construed as granting any intellectual
    property rights to you, whether by estoppel, implication or otherwise.
